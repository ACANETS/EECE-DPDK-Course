# Lab 1: Experimenting OpenFlow with Mininet
## Objectives
This lab intends to provide opportunities to learn a useful tool Mininet to design and evaluate OpenFlow based SDNs.
## Procedure
1. Please use SDN Hub VM instead of mininet VM because SDN Hub VM has more preinstalled applications (mininet, pox, OpenDayLight and wireshark) http://sdnhub.org/tutorials/sdn-tutorial-vm/
4. Get familiar with Linux commands ```cd, ls, pwd, cp, â€¦ ```
5. Mininet Walkthrough ```http://mininet.org/walkthrough/```
6. Create learning switch
	* ```https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-Learning-Switch```
	* You will need to read the below wiki page of POX controller to understand the available APIs for building your L2 learning switch ```https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki```
7. Read OpenFlow specification

## Deliverables
1. A lab report that includes screen shots of Wireshark showing the capture of OpenFlow
packets
2. The source code of a L2 Learning switch controller for POX

## Due date
Please check the course schedule on piazza.com
