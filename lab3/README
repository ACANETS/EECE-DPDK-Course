#The steps to test your ring buffer code
	1. create main.c file which has both RX and TX functionality
	1. enter "make" on the command line
	2. enter "sudo ./build/test_ring -w 0000:02:00.0 --socket-mem 256 --file-prefix rx -c 0x03" on the command line
	3. open another terminal, get into the test_echo folder, and follow its README file to start the testbench program
